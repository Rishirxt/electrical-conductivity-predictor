# 🧪 Electrical Conductivity Predictor

This project compares two machine learning models — a **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (HQCNN)** and a **Classical Neural Network (MLP)** — to predict the **electrical conductivity** of materials.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.8
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch pandas matplotlib pennylane
🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone the repo or copy the files into your project folder.

Change to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd electrical-conductivity-predictor
(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate         # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch pandas matplotlib pennylane
Run the scripts in the following order:

bash
Copy
Edit
python hqcnn.py        # Runs the Hybrid Quantum-Classical model
python classical.py    # Runs the Classical MLP model
python comparemode.py  # Compares predictions from both models
All output .csv files will be generated in the same directory for review and analysis.
